# Rover

This repository contains files related to my ongoing project to build a working all-terrain robot with a rocker-bogie suspension system. Currently those are CAD files for the wheel design (see description below), which can be found in the `wheels` folder.

## The Suspension System

This rover uses a rocker-bogie suspension system constructed with two diameters of electrical conduit.

## The Wheel Design

The wheels use an airless tire design. The central 3d-printed core is surrounded by a toroidal helical coil of cable.
